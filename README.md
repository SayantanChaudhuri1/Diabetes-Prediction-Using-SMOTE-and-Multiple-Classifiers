# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-SMOTE-and-Multiple-Classifiers
----------------------------------------------------------
#### This study presents a machine learning-based approach for diabetes prediction using structured patient data. The dataset comprises 100,000 patient records, including key risk factors such as age, BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels. Due to class imbalance in diabetic cases, SMOTE is applied to enhance model fairness.  Seven classifiers—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree—are implemented and assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrices. The results indicate that ensemble models, particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, outperform other classifiers in predictive performance. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing research on machine learning applications in healthcare, demonstrating the importance of robust preprocessing techniques and classifier selection in medical diagnosis.

### INTRODUCTION 
### Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent and life-threatening metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and blindness. The growing incidence of diabetes necessitates efficient and accurate predictive models to aid early diagnosis and intervention. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical evaluations and biochemical tests, which can be time-consuming and costly. Machine learning offers an innovative alternative, providing automated predictions with high accuracy and efficiency.
### However, challenges such as data imbalance can significantly affect the performance of ML models. The presence of imbalanced datasets, where diabetic cases are underrepresented compared to non-diabetic cases, can lead to biased predictions. This study tackles this issue by implementing SMOTE, a widely used oversampling technique that generates synthetic samples to balance the dataset.
### The primary objectives of this research are:

To implement and evaluate multiple ML classifiers for diabetes prediction.
To assess the impact of SMOTE in handling class imbalance.
To compare model performances based on key evaluation metrics.
To determine the most effective classifier for predicting diabetes.

#### DATASET
